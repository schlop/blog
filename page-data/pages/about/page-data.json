My name is Paul and I like to tinker with computers. I was born in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany and currently live in Brisbane, Australia where I am doing my PhD at The University of Queensland. Aside from my passion for IT, I love cooking, mountain biking, and exploring Queensland and the whole of Australia in a roof top tent.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/paul.jpg\" alt=\"Paul\"></p>\n<p>This blog is as much for myself as for you. I hope it will be a great place to structure my thoughts and properly document some of my projects. Just like in a real notebook. Topics that I will cover are software development, docker, ESP8266, and some other cool tech.</p>\n<p>In addition to this blog, I also have a website where I write a bit about my PhD and share a list of my publications. You can find it <a href=\"www.paulschlosser.net\">here</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/paul.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}}
